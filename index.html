				<p>Thanks to my father’s military status, I was very fortunate to be able to travel the world when I was growing up. No place I’ve been, however, compares to Northern California. Friendly folks who feel like neighbors, the influence of many diverse cultures, and a chill vibe make it easy for anyone to feel comfortable here. Five years ago, when I first visited the region, I dreamed that I could one day call it home. Three years ago, that dream became a reality, and I’m so proud to raise my daughter here and call Oakland, California my forever home!</p>
				<p>There’s nothing to not love about where I live. From the awesome weather year round to the abundance of fun family activities, it’s no wonder that my friends and family all start concocting plans to relocate after vacationing here. It doesn’t hurt that I know all of the best places to take them to make them fall in love with our neck of the woods (or beach, or city...more on that later!). Northern California, the Bay Area in particular, is the ultimate family playground. Whether you have one child like I do, or a whole group of them, there’s plenty to keep your entire family happy.</p>
				<p>Because there’s so much to do here, it’s easy to be overwhelmed by the choices. Don’t worry, Mama Knows It All has you covered! If you’re visiting the area for the first time, or you live here but want to get out and explore more, here’s a three-day itinerary that will help you cover the most ground...and have the most fun in Northern California!</p>
				<p>My best piece of advice, for your entire trip, is to start early. There are so many hidden treasures in Northern California that it’s likely you’ll discover something that will get you off schedule, so our family has learned to stay flexible and get out as soon as we can after the sun rises. Trust me, you’ll appreciate this tip when you find a cool park that you want to hang out in for an hour or so!</p>
				<h4>Day 1</h4>
				<h3>Oakland and Berkeley</h3>
				<p>I know, I know, everyone loves San Francisco. I do, too! You don’t have to rush into the city during your Northern California visit, though. In fact, it’s a good idea to pace yourself, especially if you’re traveling with children. Starting in San Francisco’s neighboring cities, Oakland and Berkeley, is a great way to start your vacation, and set the tone for the trip. Besides, they’re both extraordinarily family-friendly, with plenty to do and lots to keep the kiddos occupied and engaged.</p>

				<h5>Children’s Fairyland</h5>
				<p>Our family first fell in love with Children’s Fairyland on our first visit to Oakland. Super-duper kid-friendly, this fairytale-themed amusement park will be loved by children of all ages. Ride the Jolly Trolly Train, sit in on a puppet show, or meet new animal friends in the menagerie. You can experience the entire park in just a couple of hours, which leaves plenty of time for you to keep exploring.</p>
				<h5>Jack London Square</h5>
				<p>After Children’s Fairyland, take a short ride to Jack London Square for lunch, and you’re sure to find something interesting going on, too. It might be the day of the Farmer’s Market, there could be a dance party happening, or maybe your favorite movie is playing on the big screen. We never know what to expect when we go to Jack London Square! The one thing we can be sure of, though, is a great assortment of delicious restaurants!</p>
				<h5>Tilden Park</h5>
				<p>Once you finish lunch, it’s time to head over to Tilden Park in Berkeley. There’s a farm with a petting zoo, a carousel, botanical garden, and a steam train! Make sure you bring a blanket, because the acres of lush grass are perfect for a quick nap to refuel after you experience all the park has to offer.</p>
				<h5>Shorebird Park Nature Center and Adventure Playground</h5>
				<p>When you get your second wind, take the family to Shorebird Park Nature Center and Adventure Playground for another interesting experience.  A quintessentially Berkeley attraction, this park is unlike any playground you’ve ever been to. There's a zip line that kids and adults can ride on, and opportunities for children to build things with real hammers and nails, and to use paint to decorate their very own fort. The Shorebird Park Nature Center and Adventure Playground might be your kiddo’s favorite part of the entire day!</p>

				<h4>Day 2</h4>
				<h3>San Francisco</h3>
				<p>The starlet of Northern California is obviously San Francisco. It’s one of the most visited cities in the world. If you’re in the region, you absolutely cannot miss it. If you start in Oakland, you can take the ferry from Jack London Square over to Fisherman’s Wharf for an exciting beginning to a day in the city. Even if you don't take the ferry, BART is a super affordable way to get into San Francisco, or you can leave the car at one of the many parking garages that are available.</p>

					<h5>Fisherman’s Wharf</h5>
					<p>No matter what your plans are, Fisherman’s Wharf has to be on your agenda. There’s so much to do there! You can see some ships, get a glimpse of Alcatraz, and watch the sea lions sunbathe or play. I have to warn you, though: It might be hard to drag the family to the next attraction after they see the sea lions! They’re just so darn interesting to watch!</p>
					<h5>Chinatown</h5>
					<p>San Francisco’s Chinatown neighborhood is one of my favorite places in the city. It’s so full of color, and there are tons of little surprises in every single shop you go into. The best part of Chinatown is that you get to experience the slopes and hills that San Francisco is known for!</p>
					<h5>Golden Gate Bridge</h5>
					<p>Since it’s one of the most iconic bridges in the country, you have to go over the Golden Gate bridge if you’re in Northern California. Every few weeks I try to sweet-talk my husband into driving me over the bridge because I absolutely love the views! Not only will your kids be impressed by the sheer size and beauty of the bridge, but it takes you to one of the most lovely little cities in our area.</p>
					<h5>Sausalito</h5>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-5 col-md-offset-1">
					<img class="sect-break under" src="images/brandi/Brandi4.jpg">
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<p>After you drive over the Golden Gate Bridge, make your way to the Bay Area Discovery Museum. With its focus on imagination, creativity, and STEM activities, even the adults in the family will be engaged at the museum. There are often special events going on, so make sure you check the museum calendar before you go. After you leave, check out some of the shops in downtown Sausalito, and sit down for lunch at one of the many family-friendly restaurants in the area.</p>
					<h5>Treasure Island</h5>
					<p>To end your day, head over to Treasure Island, right at the end of the Bay Bridge, to watch the sunset. You won’t find a better view of San Francisco anywhere else. It’ll be the perfect close to a fun-filled day, and a memory that you’ll never, ever forget!</p>
					<h4>Day 3</h4>
					<h3>Northern California Wildcard</h3>
					<p>For your third day in our lovely region, I have several recommendations for day trips. Don’t forget my earlier advice to stay flexible and be open to the adventure you might find.</p>
					<h6>Option #1: Yosemite National Park</h6>
					<h5>Yosemite National Park</h5>
					<p>If you are coming to Northern California and you only have a few days, you MUST go to Yosemite National Park. It’s a 2.5-hour drive from Oakland, so if you start early in the morning, you'll have plenty of time to explore. One of the greatest parks in our country, Yosemite is absolutely breathtaking. When you and your family experience the amazing valley and beautiful waterfalls, you’ll be reminded of how beautiful our country truly is.</p>

				<div class="col-md-6">
					<h6>Option #2: Santa Cruz</h6>
					<h5>Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk</h5>
					<p>When I lived on the East Coast, one of my favorite things to do with my daughter was take a bus to the shore and hang out at the beach. Our version of that is the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk with its classic amusements, rides, and attractions. There’s a Ferris wheel, games, miniature golf, and great beach-themed foods. Your family will have the best time at the Santa Cruz Boardwalk!</p>
					<h5>Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park</h5>
					<p>If you want to experience the majesty of the beautiful redwood trees, Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park in Santa Cruz is the place to be. It’s home to some of the oldest redwoods in our state, so make sure to bring your camera to take tons of pictures of the family in this amazingly beautiful setting!</p>
					<h5>Natural Bridges State Beach</h5>
					<p>Before you leave the Santa Cruz area, make a stop at Natural Bridges State Beach to see the sun set. My husband and I had engagement photos taken here, and I can guarantee you one of the most gorgeous sunsets you’ll ever see in your life.</p>
					<h6>Option #3: San Jose</h6>
					<h5>San Jose</h5>
					<p>You may know San Jose as the tech center of Northern California, but there’s plenty for families to do there, too! Just about an hour away from Oakland, San Jose makes a fun and easy day trip. Start your morning at Happy Hollow Park and Zoo for a close up look at some really sweet animals. After that, head over to the Children’s Discovery Museum for lunch and to play. You and your kiddos will love the gardens, imaginative exhibits, and opportunities to engage with science.</p>
					<p>Now do you see why it was so easy for me to fall in love with Northern California? It’s the very best of everything our great country has to offer, and there’s no place I’d rather live, love, and have fun!</p>

				<h2>Northern California offers some of the most stunning and diverse campsites in the world—</br>explore these six options.</h2>
				<p>Whether you want to sleep at the feet of giants in Redwoods National Park or wake up at the water’s edge in Lake Tahoe, adventure seekers will marvel at Northern California’s options. From off-the-grid rustic sites to the ultimate glamping experience, here are six options for planning your next camping excursion.</p>

						<div class="box-header-num">1</div>
						<span class="stop-name">Steep Ravine Environmental Campground</span>
					</div>
					<div class="text-wrapper">
						<h5>Mount Tamalpais State Park</h5>
						<p>Although it’s a mere 45 minutes away from San Francisco, Steep Ravine feels incredibly remote. On a clear day, you can see the city’s skyline in the distance, as well as the Farallon Islands 25 miles off the coast. Pitch a tent or stay in a rustic cabin—sites for both look out on expansive ocean views perfect for watching the sunset.</p>
						<p><span class="bold">What to do:</span> Hike or drive to nearby Stinson Beach, where lifeguards are on duty from May through mid-September. On weekends, head to the mountain’s Gravity Car Barn to learn about the sloping, winding railroad that once carried passengers down by gravity alone.</p>

					<div class="text-wrapper">
						<h5>Fort Bragg</h5>
						<p>Three miles up the coast from Fort Bragg, MacKerricher State Park showcases multiple habitats—forest, beach, dunes, bluffs, wetlands, and a collection of tide pools at the shore—around its 140-plus campsites. During whale migration season (winter and spring), MacKerricher boasts nine miles of uninterrupted coastline for spotting spouts.</p>
						<p><span class="bold">What to do:</span> Take a ride on the historic Skunk Train, a 131-year-old engine that has chugged along the coastal “Redwood Route” since 1885. Horse lovers can get saddle time in at Ten Mile Beach or in Jackson State Forest. If the kiddos need a break from “all that nature,” take a swing at mini golf at the Emerald Dolphin Inn, and stop for a cone at Cowlick’s Ice Cream Café on the way back to camp. </p>

						<h5>D.L. Bliss State Park, Lake Tahoe</h5>
						<p>It’s no wonder these lakeside campgrounds are so highly coveted given their proximity to the crystal-clear waters of Lake Tahoe. The water and all of its activities wait mere feet away from your tent. Pack warm clothes for the evenings, which tend to be chilly even during the summer months.</p>
						<p><span class="bold">What to do:</span> Waterbugs will enjoy swimming, diving, or paddleboarding on the lake’s clear water. Or stay on land to lounge on the beach or explore miles of nearby trails—don’t miss the opportunity to snap a picture at Balancing Rock in the northwest section of the park. At the end of the day, join fellow campers at the campfire center to swap adventure stories.</p>

After you set up camp on the beach, hike the steep hill for a breathtaking view of Tomales Bay.</p>
						<p><span class="bold">What to do:</span> Check out Pierce Point Ranch, where you can catch a glimpse of the nearly 400 tule elk in residence at the Tule Elk Reserve. Visitors to the Kenneth C. Patrick Visitor Center at Drakes Beach can learn about 16th-century maritime exploration and check out the minke whale skeleton on display.</p>

						<p><span class="bold">What to do:</span> Bring a fly rod to cast out over nearby creeks and lakes (the camp has limited supplies available for borrowing). Book a horseback-riding excursion before you arrive. Make a checklist of local wildlife, including deer, chipmunks, hummingbirds, and marmots, and see who can spot the most! </p>

If your crew prefers a tent upgrade, you can rent a spacious “tent cabin” that sleeps four and comes with mattress pads and a wood stove.</p>
						<p><span class="bold">What to do:</span> Enjoy the park’s 80 miles of trails, punctuated by the towering trees. For a high-flying adventure, head south to Mount Hermon Adventures Redwood Canopy Tours, where explorers ages 10+ can fly through the trees on a zip-line adventure. A lower course is available for kids as young as five.</p>

				<h2>Imagine a place where towering trees meet rugged coastline, and small friendly towns greet visitors with open arms (holding cups of artisanal coffee and mason jars of craft beer). Northern California, with its massive scale and otherworldly beauty, gives off an almost mystical vibe—the yin to Southern California’s yang. Here are four must-see spots for any family looking to capture some of Northern California’s charms. </h2>

			<li class="hideContent">
				<div class="text-box">
					<p>This 129-foot-tall waterfall is one of the most jaw-dropping sights in North America. Located about 60 miles northeast of Redding, Burney Falls makes a delightful day trip. Take a hike around the falls to reach the optimum viewpoint, the overlook at McArthur-Burney Falls Memorial State Park, and you’ll see why President Teddy Roosevelt referred to the falls as the “eighth wonder of the world.”</p>
				</div>

			<li class="hideContentHeader">Shasta Lake</li>
			<li class="hideContent">
				<div class="text-box">
					<p>The largest lake in California, Shasta, is awash in watery family fun. With a whopping 370 miles of shoreline, it makes it easy to find an activity that involves your favorite watersport—from jet skiing to boating to just plain ol’ swimming. And one not-to-miss landmark is the Shasta Dam; at 602 feet high, it’s the second largest of its kind in the country and the perfect spot for a group photo. If you’re staying overnight, dine right on the water on a dinner cruise.</p>

				<div class="text-box">
					<p>Three hours north of San Francisco is the coastal cool town of Mendocino. Kids will love exploring Glass Beach, located about 10 miles north of the town of Mendocino, where deposits of colorful sea glass rest along the coves. One theory for the washed up treasure is that the sea glass is “mermaid tears,” shed every time a sailor is lost at sea. Just be sure not to take any of the glass with you—it’s best left on the beach for other visitors. On the way back to town, visit the Mendocino Coast Botanical Gardens to snap some pictures of its expansive collection of blooms, including its famous rhododendrons. Thirty miles south of town, check out the B Bryan Preserve, where you capture snaps of exotic animals like antelopes, kudus, zebras, and giraffes.</p>

				<div class="text-box">
					<p>After a drive north through towering redwood forests, you’ll most definitely know when you’ve stumbled upon this Victorian-architecture-laden town along the coast. Eureka, 280 miles north of San Francisco, is not only worth a visit in and of itself—stroll along the seaside boardwalk and on the streets of old town, stopping at the intriguing Clarke Historical Museum. About an hour from Eureka on Highway 299 go hunting for Bigfoot at the Willow Creek-China Flat Museum. You’ll find footprint casts, Bigfoot pictures, and a collection of other odds and ends.</p>

				<h2>The Avenue of the Giants, a 30-mile stretch of Highway 101,<br>is arguably one of America’s coolest drives.</h2>
				<p>For a slice of Americana, complete with trees you can drive right through, take the family on a road trip along Highway 101. The route, starting from Phillipsville (roughly 225 miles north of San Francisco on the 101) and going north to Stafford, cuts through California’s Humboldt Redwoods State Park, home to the densest concentration of old-growth redwoods in the world. Here’s a guide for where to roam along this iconic stretch of road. It’s a drive so spectacular you may not hear an “Are we there yet?” the whole time.</p>

								<p>Before you set out, fuel up on grass-fed-beef burgers, fresh baked goods, and soft-serve ice cream at the whimsical Chimney Tree Grill in the town of Phillipsville. The restaurant is next to the Living Chimney Tree, which was hollowed by a fire in 1914. Visitors can walk into the room-like space, entering through a front door, to check out the tree’s interior.</p>

								<p>There are three redwoods you can drive a car through in California. The Shrine Drive-Tbrough iTree has the distinction of being the only one hollowed out by nature. Goose pens, as these interior spaces are known, are caused by fires, which burn out the interior of the tree but leave the exterior intact and alive. You’ll pay a small fee to pass through this privately owned redwood. Stop off in Myers Flat for the locally lauded Daily Grind espresso house or a visit to Riverbend Cellars for a laid back local wine tasting. If you have young kids, venture a mile farther to the Williams Grove day use area where you’ll access the Children’s Forest trail. This quiet, pretty 2-mile loop has plenty of fun exploration opportunities for little ones.</p>

				<div class="text-box">
					<p>With more than 400 acres of wildlife preserve and 900 different animals representing 90 species, Safari West re-creates a day in the wild—in the heart of California wine country. Safari tours in a double-decker Korean War Vintage Power Wagons run three hours and bring you into contact with gazelles, giraffes, zebras, antelope, and other fauna and flora indigenous to Northern Tanzania. You can even “camp” in a luxury safari tent complete with hardwood floors, beds, and full bathrooms, falling asleep to the calls of exotic birds.</p>

					<p>Wear comfortable walking shoes when you visit, because the Sacramento Zoo spans 14.5 acres, and you’ll want to see all of it. The zoo is home to over 500 animals of more than 140 different species, including red pandas, snow leopards, eagles, and various reptiles. If you’re looking for more than a leisurely stroll and casual viewing, you can sign up for educational classes and day camps. And if you want to see the animals in action at all hours, you can bring a tent and sleeping bags for a back-to-nature overnighter.</p>

Knee-high daredevils can ride the Flying Dragon Roller Coaster, spin in the Crazy Cups, and fly in a swinging log on the Squirrelly Whirl. There are also scaled-down boats, cars, trains, and planes for climbing on and exploring. You can also all pile into one of the Backroads Buggies, Funderland’s classic cars that let little drivers zoom around the park.</p>

				<p>We love visiting Central California because it gives us a beautiful mix of the ocean, the mountains, and farm life. It offers some of the best wineries on the West Coast, has little-known towns, and features fun little eateries sprinkled throughout the coast. Now that summer is coming up, we’ve started planning our next family road trip up to Central California, and it includes a handful of adventure-filled stops. The Central Valley and the Central Coast are where we’ll be spending the majority of our time because they’re both just a short drive away from Los Angeles. Want to plan your own Central California road trip and need ideas? Read on for our three-day family road trip itinerary!</p>
				<h4>Day 1</h4>
				<h3>Santa Barbara</h3>
				<p>Closest to Los Angeles is the beautiful city of Santa Barbara. You’ll find this historic spot about an hour and a half north of L.A. Santa Barbara is known for its shopping, dining, and gorgeous scenery. This city is a big hit for multi-generational groups because it offers a lot of activities, including the Old Mission Santa Barbara, the Santa Barbara Zoo, and museums with a heavy emphasis on nature and history. And of course, the beach is always a hit too.</p>
				<h5>You can find us at...</h5>
				<p>The Farmers Market in Downtown Santa Barbara on Tuesdays and Saturdays. There’s plenty of locally grown produce, along with an array of restaurants offering everything from pizza to tacos, served alongside some of the best wine in the state of California.</p>
				<h4>Day 2</h4>
				<h3>Solvang</h3>
				<p>About an hour away from Santa Barbara is a quaint little town called Solvang. Driving into Solvang will make you feel as though you’re stepping back in time. You will immediately get the small-town feel (it has a population of about 5,500) as you drive down its one major road and past its mom-and-pop shops and well-known bakeries. Founded by a group of Danes in 1911, the town gives you the feeling that it hasn’t changed much since then.</p>

				<p>Solvang is still home to bakeries, restaurants, and merchants who have continued to offer a taste of Denmark through its food, landscape, and museums.</p>
				<h5>You can find us at...</h5>
				<p>The shoe store trying on a pair of clogs, the local bookstore peeking into the Hans Christian Andersen museum upstairs, and, of course, around Copenhagen replicas like the Little Mermaid statue and the Round Tower, taking family pictures. We’ll also be stopping by Old Mission Santa Inés near the center of town. Just outside of Solvang, we’ll stop by OstrichLand USA—a ranch where visitors can see ostriches, feed them, and even buy their eggs!</p>
				<h4>Day 3</h4>
				<h3>Central Valley</h3>
				<p>Covering a large piece of California is the Central Valley. This area is known for producing an abundance of fresh fruits, vegetables, and greenery, coupled with its small-town feel and country atmosphere. Highway 99 will take you where you need to go, but your family will enjoy discovering off-the-beaten-path destinations the most.</p>
				<h5>You can find us at...</h5>
				<p>The produce stands, stocking up on in-season fruits. We’d like to visit UC Davis and rent bikes to discover the campus, and maybe take some time for some much-needed water play at The Delta. There, you can do everything from waterskiing to fishing to wildlife watching.</p>

				<p>Central California is a wonderful region of the Golden State, with the ocean and mountains surrounding the family-owned farms and quaint towns that you’ll run into simply by driving down the scenic highways. Families can always find something that they enjoy doing. Whether we choose a day at the beach, a tour of historic missions, or fruit picking at a farm, Central California will give us three days of fun, great meals, and bonding moments that will carry us into our future California travels.</p>

			<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
				<h2>As cars zip between Los Angeles and San Francisco on the I-5 and U.S. Highway 101, Central California is quietly living the good life. </h2>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>While San Francisco is considered a technology hub and Los Angeles boasts a booming entertainment industry, there’s a lot to be seen between the two major cities. Central California has charming towns dotting the coastline, and destinations like Yosemite National Park farther inland. The valley yields a quarter of all produce and 40% of nuts, fruits and other foods in the U.S., and from crops to coastline, Central California is a friendly and relaxed swath of the Golden State to explore.</p>

				<h3>On the Water</h3>
				<p>For an iconic road trip, cruise up the Central California coastline. Start in Santa Barbara, a friendly town full of family fun. Don’t miss the zoo and botanic garden.</p>

				<p>Hop back in the car and snake up the coast, passing historic and charming San Luis Obispo, stopping for a California history lesson at the Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa. Then veer onto The Pacific Coast Highway (Highway 1, or PCH as locals call it). Designate a family member as a photographer to capture the views.</p>

				<p>Just before reaching Monterey Bay, stretch your legs in Carmel-by-the-Sea. This enchanting coastal town just south of Monterey is like a California-set fairytale. Stroll the quaint streets of downtown and wander into shops and restaurants, or head to the water for a day at the beach (Carmel Beach is dog-friendly, so furry friends can get in on the fun). Golfers should make a pilgrimage to The Golf Links at the Pebble Beach Resorts, rated the number one public course in the U.S., and kids will find ample amounts of fun, including horseback riding on the beach and story time and crafts at the local library.</p>

				<p>One cannot cruise up the PCH without stopping in Santa Cruz. Kids will love a trip to the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, an amusement park (complete with the wooden Giant Dipper roller coaster, which first rolled out in 1924).</p>

				<h3>Inland Exploring</h3>
				<p>Attractions east of the coastline are just as dazzling as their oceanfront counterparts. Some of the coolest adventures might be right under your nose, as in <a href="http://www.visitcalifornia.com/feature/13-ways-go-underground-california">way underground</a>. Start with a tour of the massive underground chamber at Moaning Caverns Adventure Park—the vertical chamber is large enough to fit the Statue of Liberty. Families can go on guided walking tours into the cave, or opt to rappel down 165 feet into the cavern (best for older adventurers). Back above ground, take flight on zip lines that run above the foothills.</p>

				<p>Continue heading inland to awe-inspiring Yosemite National Park. Book a room at the historic Tenaya Lodge, nicely situated as a base for exploring, and then go hiking or to attend one of the many nature talks that take place in the Yosemite Valley. Kids can participate in ranger programs, learning about the geological history of the area, or partake in an art class (all ages welcome) focused on nature.</p>

				<p>Forty miles east of Yosemite Valley sits Mono Lake (“Mono” rhymes with “yoyo,” FYI), with its otherworldly landscape of strange rock forms. The visitor center, just off U.S. 395 north of Lee Vining and Tioga Pass, offers a wealth of information and scientific exploration.</p>

					<p>Yosemite, considered one of the crown jewels of the national park system, lies 200 miles east of historic San Francisco. Best known for its immense granite cliff faces, crashing waterfalls, and unmatched parkland, the expansive grounds should be seen on foot over several days. Hikes range from short strolls (Glacier Point and Tuolumne Meadows) to more demanding treks, like the 7.2-mile walk to the top of Yosemite Falls (not recommended for young children). Science-minded little ones can visit the Nature Center or Yosemite Valley Visitor Center to learn about life in the park through interactive exhibits, and can even study to become Junior Rangers (ages 7-13) or Little Cubs (ages 3-6).</p>

Kids will love exploring on day hikes (look for paved trails for younger ones), adventuring on an overnight wilderness trip, or learning about the park via a ranger-led program, like the Kids’ Campfire Talks. And a bonus for any family with a fourth-grade student: You can earn a free pass through the Every Kid in a Park program.</p>

				<h4>Death Valley National Park</h4>
				<div class="text-box">
					<p>Don’t let its name fool you. This famed spread of 3.4 million acres of desert and mountains is one of the most uniquely beautiful places on earth. Hikes will reveal vivid flood-carved caverns, gigantic sand dunes, crystalized salt flats, or lush oases that harbor tiny fish. Golf enthusiasts can play a morning round at 214 feet below sea level at the Furnace Creek Resort. Several air-conditioned lodges and a visitor’s center showing educational films offer respite from the legendary desert heat. Take the kids for a walk in the moonlight to spot a full spectrum of the desert, stars, and planets that comes to life at night, or cool off with a dip in the pool at Stovepipe Wells Village. They’ll also love hopping on a horse at Furnace Creek Ranch or having their photo taken at Badwater Basin (major bragging rights—it’s the lowest-elevation spot in North America)!</p>

				<p>Pint-size picky eater in the back seat? Fret not. Families driving through the Central Valley can take full advantage of the region’s fresh, local ingredients.

				<h3>Farm Fresh Fruit</h3>
				<p>With a double-decker Venetian carousel and a train dubbed Casa de Choo Choo, <span class="bold">Casa de Fruta</span> in Hollister (roughly 50 miles inland from Santa Cruz) is a dream pit stop for kids. Visit the roadside stand for just-picked produce, and load up on fruits and vegetables before hopping back in the car—they’ll be the perfect road-trip snack.</p>

				<p>Harry Snyder couldn’t possibly have known what he was creating when he opened California’s first drive-thru burger stand in 1948. Fast-forward to 2015, and the 300th <span class="bold">In-N-Out Burger</span> restaurant—now operating in five states—opens, a testament to the cult-like following. Go for the classic burgers, and stay for the famous shakes (choose from classic chocolate, strawberry and vanilla flavors, or order one of each!). For an insider experience, ask about the not-so-secret secret menu.</p>

				<p>I have lived in California almost my entire life, and I couldn’t imagine raising my kids anywhere else! Southern California is unique because you can visit the beach, go to Disneyland, or play in the snow, usually within a two hour drive….you really can’t find that anywhere else! If you haven’t visited the Golden State yet, let us show you around. Here are 25 of our favorite spots with a lot of hidden gems in between!</p>
				<p>Let’s start with the fabulous amusement parks you will find here in Southern California. You can’t pass these by:</p>
				<h4>1</h4>
				<h3>Disneyland</h3>
				<p>When you think of California, you probably picture Mickey Mouse, and a trip to Disneyland is definitely something every child (and adult) will remember forever!</p>
				<h4>2</h4>
				<h3>Disney California Adventure Park</h3>
				<p>On the same grounds as Disneyland, this second park is unique; it offers live entertainment and an extended Disney feel, with additional rides like our favorite, Soarin’ Over California.</p>
				<h4>3</h4>
				<h3>Knott’s Berry Farm</h3>
				<p>Knott’s really has something for everyone, with lots of live entertainment too, which we love. There are smaller rides in Camp Snoopy, classics like the Log Ride, and roller coasters for the more daring. Throughout the year they have special events during Christmas, their Boysenberry Festival, and more, which keep it fresh.</p>
				<h4>4</h4>
				<h3>Universal Studios Hollywood</h3>
				<p>A really fun place for rides and live entertainment featuring your favorite movie characters, and their studio tour is amazing. We love seeing where some of our favorite movies were filmed!</p>

				<h4>5</h4>
				<h3>LEGOLAND</h3>
				<p>A fun place for younger kids, especially those who love building! There are not only fun rides at LEGOLAND but building stations, a great waterpark, and Sea Life Aquarium adjacent to the park as well. It’s fascinating what they’ve made out of LEGO bricks!</p>
				<p class="italc">Let’s move on to a few water locations we love in Southern California! Some of them you may have heard of, and others are hidden gems that are must-sees during your visit here.</p>
				<h4>6</h4>
				<h3>SeaWorld San Diego</h3>
				<p>This park has changed a lot over the years and even has a few roller coasters too! Our favorite attractions are still the shows (with seasonal offerings as well), and the hands-on exhibits are always a hit.</p>
				<h4>7</h4>
				<h3>The Queen Mary</h3>
				<p>This floating hotel in Long Beach offers tours. Even my kids thought it was fascinating to see the artifacts and the exhibits on the ship. In the winter months there’s the <a href="http://temeculablogs.com/queen-mary-ice-kingdom-discounted-tickets/">Queen Mary CHILL</a> with ice sculptures, tubing, skating, and more (this has become our annual tradition).</p>
				<h4>8</h4>
				<h3>Aquarium of the Pacific</h3>
				<p>This is quite a large aquarium, located in Long Beach, with a lot of outside exhibits, such as a penguin habitat and shark-touch pools that we haven’t seen anywhere else!</p>
				<h4>9</h4>
				<h3>Birch Aquarium at Scripps</h3>
				<p>Located in La Jolla, this aquarium offers a lot of hands-on exhibits for kids, and half of the facility is outdoors, which we love! Featuring interactive exhibits and exciting science displays, it’s great for little hands and in an absolutely gorgeous location overlooking the beach.</p>
				<h4>10</h4>
				<h3>Tide Pools</h3>
				<p>We love visiting the many tide pools in Southern California! One of our favorite spots is in <a href="http://temeculablogs.com/la-jolla-tide-pools/">La Jolla, called Children’s Pool</a>. There’s a beach where you can look for small sea creatures and get up close and personal with the harbor seals and sea lions, who love to sun themselves!</p>

				<h4>11</h4>
				<h3>Ocean Institute</h3>
				<p>If you’re coming to Southern California to visit the ocean and all it has to offer, this is a great place to visit in Dana Point! They offer hands-on exploration, and taking a whale-watching trip is a must, too…it’s amazing!</p>

				<h4>12</h4>
				<h3>Huntington Beach Adventure Playground</h3>
				<p>This is a hidden gem! If your childhood included playing in mud puddles, sliding down slippery slopes with your friends, and not caring about how dirty you got….your kids will get to experience that kind of down-home fun here too!</p>
				<h4>13</h4>
				<h3>Waterparks</h3>
				<p>There are <a href="http://temeculablogs.com/water-parks-southern-california/">so many great waterparks in Southern California</a>, and since it is warm basically year round here you can visit them often!</p>
				<h4>14</h4>
				<h3>The beach</h3>
				<p>I’d be here all day if I listed all of the beaches we love, and since there are so many, we like visiting a new one each time we head out for some sun and sand. Two of our favorites are Carlsbad State Beach and San Clemente State Beach, because we lived there for many years. There is a playground, and lots of parking.</p>

				<p class="italc">If you’re an animal lover and you’re looking for fun places in Southern California to visit them, there are several locations, both big and small.</p>
				<h4>15</h4>
				<h3>San Diego Zoo Safari Park</h3>
				<p>Probably one of our favorite places to go and see animals roaming the acres and acres of land. Their Africa Tram is like nothing you’ve ever been on, as it takes you on a half hour tour that allows you to see the animals up close.</p>
				<h4>16</h4>
				<h3>Rancho Las Lomas</h3>
				<p>A true hidden gem! This is a great zoological garden with rescued animals that can no longer live in the wild for a variety of reasons. You can get up close with unique animals and take a tour of the facility, which is nestled in the small city of Silverado. It’s pretty neat.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<h4>17</h4>
				<h3>Bates Nut Farm</h3>
				<p>Our favorite hidden gem!! My kids love feeding animals, seasonal festivals, and large fields where we can have a picnic and run free. Bates offers all of these things! Each season offers something new with a small-town feel, and it’s become our tradition each October to pick pumpkins right off the vine!</p>
				<p class="italc">Now we’re moving right along to several fun children’s museums we have here in Southern California that we visit quite often and are a must-see!</p>
				<h4>18</h4>
				<h3>Discovery Cube OC</h3>
				<p>One of our all-time favorite hands-on museums for children in Orange County is called Discovery Cube OC. Throughout the year they offer different exhibits and incredible shows like the Bubblefest you see here! Children can pretend they’re hockey players, shop at a grocery store meant just for them, learn all about hurricanes and much more. It’s three stories full of fun, and you can easily spend the whole day there!</p>
				<h4>19</h4>
				<h3>Pennypickle’s Workshop</h3>
				<p>Another hidden gem! We love visiting small places like this one and sharing them with others. Although it’s on a smaller scale, this children’s museum is very interactive and is located in a quaint area of Old Town Temecula, which is fun to walk around after your visit there.</p>
				<h4>20</h4>
				<h3>Orange Empire Railway Museum</h3>
				<p>If you’re a train enthusiast, this is a great place to visit! There are different events year round, and they even have Thomas the Tank Engine visit each year!</p>
				<p class="italc">Now let’s get back outdoors, shall we! There are so many great places to camp and hike in Southern California and we have visited many of them, so let me share a few of our favorites.</p>
				<h4>21</h4>
				<h3>Idyllwild</h3>
				<p>We visit Idyllwild often because it isn’t too far from our home in Temecula and it’s such a gorgeous area to take a walk, have a picnic, and just unplug as a family. It reminds us of a smaller version of Yosemite, offering small campgrounds as well as a lake just outside of town, called Lake Hemet, where sometimes we just skip rocks and chat.</p>
				<h4>22</h4>
				<h3>Santa Rosa Plateau</h3>
				<p>Our all-time favorite place to hike! Gorgeous isn’t a big enough word to describe this area. There are many trails to choose from and it’s fairly flat, so it’s easy for children to join the fun! We pack a picnic and head out for an afternoon together often, and we always see something new.</p>

				<h3>Julian</h3>
				<p>Another hidden gem! We love finding small quaint towns like this one and just making a day trip of it. It’s a great little place to stay at a bed-and-breakfast, explore the beautiful woody area, visit their underground candy mine, and have a slice of their noteworthy apple pie!</p>
				<p class="italc">To round out our list of 25 reasons to visit California, we want to share a few great places where you can pick your own veggies and fruit….so much fun with kids!</p>
				<h4>24</h4>
				<h3>Tanaka Farms</h3>
				<p>Not only can you pick your own fruits and vegetables, but you can take a CookOut Tour, where they will help grill what you’ve picked right then and there! Very educational and fun for adults and kids!</p>
				<h4>25</h4>
				<h3>Temecula Blueberry Company</h3>
				<p>This is a fantastic hidden gem! There are many strawberry fields here and there, but it’s rare to find a blueberry field where you can gather your own fruit right off the bush and bring it home that day. Offering movie nights during the summer, story time, and a few farm animals, it’s a fun experience for little hands and delicious for everyone!</p>
				<p class="italc">From <a href="http://temeculablogs.com/">The Typical Mom</a> family to yours, I hope you find several activities you love among our suggestions here and make memories with each other this year that will last a lifetime!</p>

SeaWorld also features several adrenaline-pumping rides, including the Manta high-speed roller coaster.

Meanwhile you can descend into the depths of the farm’s “gold mine” to see the famed Calico Glory Hole. But Knott’s Berry Farm is definitely not stuck in the past. The park also features numerous thrill rides, a water park, and roller coasters. And this summer it will unveil Voyage to the Iron Reef, a new 4-D interactive ride—definitely of the 21st Century.</p>

					<p>Disneyland first opened its doors 60 years ago with a handful of rides and costumed characters strolling the grounds. Today the original site of the park boasts two separate theme parks—Disneyland and Disney California Adventure—featuring over 100 attractions and shows that revolve around Walt Disney’s beloved storybook and movie characters, but with some current additions. You can still “fly” with Dumbo and spin in a Wonderland teacup. But now you can also take a submarine voyage with Nemo and zoom on a high-octane race through Cars Land. There are also action movie-themed adventures, such as the Indiana Jones™ thrill ride and several exciting Star Wars–themed attractions that have recently made their debut.</p>

New this summer is Castle Park’s five-level water playground, Buccaneer Cove, which features water slides, water tunnels, and water spray cannons.

With a four-to-one student-to-teacher ratio, your son or daughter will get personalized attention during a week of 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. full-day sessions (half days also available).
